### Forked from: [https://github.com/roblouie/tmd](https://github.com/roblouie/tmd)

## Context

The code from the `/src/roblouie_tmd` was forked from the repo mentioned above, and the credits goes to the original author.

However, the code was drastically changed for 3 main reasons:

- Support the latest version of three.js (which required a big refactor of the threejs-converters)
- Cleanup of unused code that was not used by this project
- Studying of the TMD/TIM models and also cleanup of TS issues
